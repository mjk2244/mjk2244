### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Matt, and I'm a senior in Columbia College studying computer science. Before coming to Columbia, I grew up in Los Angeles, California. In my free time, I like watching football and basketball (Go Nets!), listening to fantasy football podcasts (8x champion), and playing Spikeball with my friends. I am looking to contribute to any sports or sports analytics-based projects.
